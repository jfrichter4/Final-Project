Now, make a zip list compiling A:4,A-:3.67, etc,.
Then, have something with <Question> that makes the code know what weighted means and what unweighted means.
After, have something with <Then> that adds the numbers together and then divides them over how many grades there were.
Finally, have something with <After> that displays the GPA.
